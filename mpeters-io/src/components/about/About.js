        <article>
          <p>After graduating in May of 2008 with a degree in Psychology, I had two options: Continue on to grad school, or bite the bullet and enter the workforce.</p>
          <p>Since I was on the fence about continuing my education (and incurring more debt) I decided to try the job market, and ended up applying to an insurance company in New York City through a local referral (a cool story, but one for another time). The company took new grads and trained them on the job with full pay and benefits, and the best part… I got to check off one of my life goals of living in the city I dreamt about as a kid.</p>
          <p>Unbeknownst to me, we were in the middle of the longest period of economic decline since the Great Depression of the 1930s, and miraculously, in November 2008 I ended up with a decent job fresh out of college. I was one of the lucky ones, but was also willing to start a career outside of my field of study with little to no knowledge of the industry. That company took a risk, which I’ll be forever thankful for.</p>
          <p>The job? A 3rd Party Liability Claims Examiner for a Property and Casualty insurance carrier, servicing (mostly) the tristate area. Confused? Don’t worry, like the financial industry the insurance industry uses confusing lingo to throw you off your game.</p>
          <p>The translation? I was the company’s contact for slip and falls (mostly) and the claims made against the buildings in which those slip and falls occurred. Trust me, it’s as exciting (and frustrating) as you think. Probably more so.</p>
          <p>But hey… in those troubled times a job is a job. Plus I respected my bosses and liked my coworkers. I could take or leave the work, but everything else was a pleasure.</p>
          <p>Flash forward a few years: I’ve been promoted, moved to a different department, different apartment (a few), and am doing well in my social life, love life and career.</p>
          <p>However, something was off. Though I found a place at my company, the work wasn’t fulfilling, and the thought of handling claims until retirement was crushing. I dreamt of something else that would give me the fulfillment I desired.</p>
          <p>I always knew about web development, having made some spiffy geocities sites in my High School years (and no, you can’t see them), but never considered it as a career as I was intimidated by math I thought was required. The younger me didn’t have a “Growth” mindset, which I realize now was foolish. My research into the field showed this industry was much more lenient on formal education as a barrier to entry, which was attractive, given the cost of education only goes one way.</p>
          <p>I have since learned so much and am excited to show you what I’ve been working on. Coding has been a breath a fresh air, with the possibilities (and things to learn) seemingly endless. Please check out my resume for a more formal look at my education, past experience, and projects.</p>
